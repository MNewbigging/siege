Resolving Siege Engines:
 - Highlight the ones that need to be resolved
 - Player must click to proceed/resolve
 - Must be done left-right

 Create an array property in game state for this step. When/before the round stage starts,
 find the active siege engines in this round and add them to the 'resolveSieges' array.

 Fire an event whenever resolveSieges changes. Siege cards listen for this, check if they are the
 next siege to resolve and if so will highlight and assign a callback on click for the resolution.

 On each resolve function, pop that resolved siege from resolveSieges and check if empty - if so
 then proceed to next stage


Drag behaviour:
- 'freely' anywhere onto the card
